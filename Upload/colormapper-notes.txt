	0.0.1.0
		
		[Main]
			- First pre-release version.
			- Added a 1 pixel preview aswell to go along with the 2 pixel preview, likely to have a zoom option at some point.
			- Some interface design and changes.
		[Interface]
			- Might not be self-explanatory, 
				my suggestion would be to try out the buttons first, before doing any major drawing.				
		[Controls]
			- Left click paints, right click removes, same for pressing down respectively.
			- Wheel changes color on the palette, down towards lighter colors, up towards darker colors.
			- Control clicking picks the color from the canvas.
			- Shift clicking paints whole colors with the selected color, not to be confused with "fill" (yet to be implemented)
			- While saving / loading is open, pressing Escape halts the saving / loading, 
				and after typing a name, enter submits for saving / loading. (Yet to do some design)
		[Code]
			- Some clean ups.				
		[Tweaks]			
			- Color palette's moved a bit.
			- Highlights for selected color, transparent color 
				and marker (for animation making, otherwise the software reads the first colored pixel for measuring).
			- Removed some duplicate color calculations from palette.
			- Prepared colors list lengthened a bit.
