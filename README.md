# ColorMapper
A color mapper for the engine.

Support 16x16 color maps, some chooseable colors and a save feature to print the map out in a file, for either to be loaded by the engine or just copypasting to a file for defining.


To do: A cleaned up version, more colors and sizes, maybe a load feature.
